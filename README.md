# üí´ About Me:
I am currently in my third year of a Bachelor's in Engineering Physics at Instituto Superior T√©cnico in Lisbon. My academic journey has allowed me to develop technical skills such as programming, Robot Operating System (ROS), and Git, while deepening my understanding of fundamental physics and engineering principles.<br><br>Before joining Instituto Superior T√©cnico, I graduated with honors from Col√©gio Vasco da Gama, where I consistently ranked among the top students. I was recognized with the Merit Diploma, Excellence Board (Diploma de M√©rito, Quadro de Excel√™ncia) for my exceptional academic performance, maintaining a GPA of 19.5/20. My high school years provided me with a strong academic foundation in mathematics, physics, and engineering, as well as valuable experiences in leadership and teamwork.<br><br>I am passionate about applying my knowledge to solve real-world problems and look forward to furthering my career in engineering. I am actively seeking opportunities to gain practical experience through internships or research projects that will allow me to contribute and grow in the field.
