# About Me:
I am a third-year Engineering Physics student at Instituto Superior T√©cnico. My academic background has provided me with strong problem-solving and analytical skills, supported by advanced training in mathematics, physics, and engineering.

Alongside my studies, I have developed an interest in software engineering, particularly in web development. I have experience with Python and JavaScript, and a working understanding of algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented programming. I'm familiar with version control using Git in both solo and collaborative projects.

In summer 2025, I will be joining Intapp as a Software Engineering Intern in their Lisbon office. I am excited to apply what I have learned in a professional setting and contribute to real-world software projects.

Before university, I graduated with a GPA of 19.5/20 from Col√©gio Vasco da Gama, earning multiple academic distinctions.

I am currently looking for internship or research opportunities in software engineering to apply and deepen my skills in a practical context.
